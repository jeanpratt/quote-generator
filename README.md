# Inspirational Quote Generator

A small project that selects a random quote from a list of 20+ JSON objects to display to the user. Allows for filtering by tag, where the tags are dynamically pulled from the JSON list.

Since the app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), the following scripts are available if the project is cloned on your local machine:

* `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
* `npm test` - Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode
* `npm build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
* `npm eject` - **Permanently** removes the single build dependency from this project

For more information on the scripts listed above, please check the documentation for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What's next?

I like this random quote generator, but I'm always down for some self-improvement. Here's a list of items I'd like to do to improve what I have:

[] Create way for users to search using the same terms
[] Add 10 more quotes for each tag

## Why does this exist?

Because I like to code and I like to stay positive. Plus it was a great learning experience!
